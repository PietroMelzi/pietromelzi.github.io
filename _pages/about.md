My name is Pietro. I’m an Italian engineer and researcher currently living in Madrid. On this site, I share my professional journey and some of the things I enjoy building and learning along the way.

I moved to Madrid in 2021 to start my PhD at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. During my <b>PhD, concluded cum laude</b>, I had the chance to <a href="people">collaborate with international scientists from academia and industry and present my work at top conferences</a>. Today, I’m an AI Engineer at <a href="https://www.spartacommodities.com/">Sparta Commodities</a>, where I apply AI and LLM technologies to solve real-world problems and help build an <b>AI-first platform for commodity trading</b>.

Outside of AI, I’m passionate about <b>running, working out, hiking, team sports, and surfing</b>. I’ve run <a href="/running/">several half marathons, trail races, and a marathon</a>, with personal bests of 1h25 (half) and 3h04 (full). I also love <b>road trips, discovering new places, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle</b>. Some favorite trips so far: <a href="/trips/">Peru, Thailand, and Costa Rica</a>. I’m always curious and eager to learn more, especially in <b>AI, finance, and geography</b>.

To combine my passions for tech and sport, I created <a href="https://portalrunner.vercel.app/">PortalRunner</a>, an <b>LLM-powered generator of training and nutrition plans</b>. Through this project, I’ve explored full-stack development with a variety of technologies, and I plan to keep expanding it to better support runners.
