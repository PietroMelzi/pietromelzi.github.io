<b> Welcome! I'm Pietro, an Italian AI engineer and researcher currently living in Madrid.</b> I completed my PhD at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, and this site is a place where I share my passions in research, publications, projects, and professional experiences. My work primarily focuses on <b>deep learning, computer vision, generative AI, LLMs, reinforcement learning, and data engineering</b>.

During my PhD, I had the chance to <a href='people'>collaborating with international scientists from academia and industry, and present my work at top conferences</a>. Today, I'm an AI Engineer at [Sparta Commodities](https://www.spartacommodities.com/), where I apply state-of-the-art LLM and data engineering techniques to real-world challenges.

Outside of AI, I’m passionate about <b>running, working out, hiking, team sports, and surf</b>. My half marathon personal best is 1h25 and I am currently training for [my first marathon](https://www.valenciaciudaddelrunning.com/maraton/maraton/). I also love <b>road trips, discovering new places, and keeping a healthy lifestyle</b>. Some of my favorite journeys so far have taken me to Peru, Thailand, Lapland, and Canary Islands. I’m always curious and eager to learn more, especially in <b>AI, finance, and geography</b>.

To combine my passions for tech and sport, I created [PortalRunner](https://portalrunner.vercel.app/), a <b>generator of training and nutrition plans</b>. Through this project, I explored full-stack development, worked with a variety of technologies, and built an integration with the Strava API. In the future, I plan to expand it to cover more needs for runners.

<b> Feel free to try [PortalRunner](https://portalrunner.vercel.app/) and connect with me on social media! </b>
