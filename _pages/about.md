Hi, my name is Pietro! I'm Italian and currently based in the vibrant city of Madrid, where I'm approaching the completion of my PhD studies at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.

Here, you'll find insights into my research passions, publications, ongoing projects, and professional experiences. My research interests span across diverse areas including <b> Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Generative AI, Biometrics, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning.</b> 

During my PhD, <a href='people'>I've collaborated with numerous international scientists from both industry and academia, and presented research findings at prestigious conferences</a>. For my next chapter, <b> I'm seeking opportunities for continous learning with cutting-edge technologies in the world of AI.</b>

Beyond academia, I stay active with running, working out, hiking, and team sports. I'm passionate about road trips and prioritize maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I read a lot, always aiming to broaden my knowledge, particularly in AI, finance, and geography.

<b> Feel free to connect with me on social media—I welcome any opportunity for exchange and collaboration! </b>
