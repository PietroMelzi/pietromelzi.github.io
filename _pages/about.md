Welcome to my personal website! I'm Pietro, an Italian currently based in the vibrant city of Madrid. I near the completion of my PhD, and I'm excited to share my journey and interests with you.

Here, you'll find insights into my research passions, publications, ongoing projects, and professional experiences. My research interests span across diverse areas including <b> Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Generative AI, Biometrics, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning.</b> 

Throughout my PhD, <a href='people'>I've collaborated with international scientists from industry and academia, presenting our findings at prestigious conferences</a>. As I embark on the next chapter, <b> I'm seeking opportunities to embrace cutting-edge technologies and novel challenges in the world of AI.</b>

Beyond academia, I enjoy staying active through sports like running, working out, and hiking. I'm an avid reader, always striving to expand my knowledge, especially in AI, finance, and geography. Additionally, I'm passionate about road trips and prioritize maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

<b> Feel free to connect with me on social mediaâ€”I welcome any opportunity for exchange and collaboration! </b>
