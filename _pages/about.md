<b> Welcome! I'm Pietro, an Italian AI enthusiast currently based in Madrid.</b> I completed my PhD at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, and this space is dedicated to sharing my research passions, publications, ongoing projects, and professional experiences. My work primarily focuses on <b>Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Generative AI, LLMs, Reinforcement Learning, and Data Engineering</b>.

During my PhD, I had the privilege of <a href='people'>collaborating with international scientists from both industry and academia, and presenting my research at prestigious conferences</a>. I'm now an AI Engineer at [Sparta Commodities](https://www.spartacommodities.com/), working remotely and applying cutting-edge LLM and data engineering technologies.

Beyond the tech world, I’m passionate about fitness, including running, working out, hiking, and team sports. My personal best in the half marathon is 1 hour 28 minutes. I also love road trips, exploring new places, and leading a healthy lifestyle—some of my favorite destinations include Peru, Lanzarote, and Lapland. I’m always seeking to deepen my knowledge, particularly in AI, finance, and geography.

<b> Feel free to connect with me on social media—I'm always excited about new opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange! </b>
